# Basic GraphQL Course

> [Take the course!](https://platzi.com/cursos/graphql)

While the course is pretty outdated and IMO uses some bad practices ðŸ˜©, I learnt
the basics of GraphQL.

While try to use it in my next projects!

## Start

Check the `.env.example` file, you will need a MongoDB URI, you can get it from
an online service or just run it on local ðŸš€

Chose any DB Name you want, and set `NODE_ENV` to `production` or `development`.

> [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) is the package manager used.

Production

```sh
pnpm start-build
```

Development

```sh
NODE_OPTIONS='--es-module-specifier-resolution=node' pnpm dev-node
```

If you check the [`package.json`](./package.json) there are a lot of scripts,
the setup was a lot simpler, but I wanted to use
[top-level await](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-8.html#top-level-await)
so to do that I need to use type module, some tools, like `ts-node` or derivate,
doesn't support ESM yet.
