# Basic GraphQL Course

> [Take the course!](https://platzi.com/cursos/graphql)

While the course is pretty outdated and IMO uses some bad practices ðŸ˜©, I learnt
the basics of GraphQL.

While try to use it in my next projects!

## Start

Check the `.env.example` file, you will need a MongoDB URI, you can get it from
an online service or just run it on local ðŸš€

Chose any DB Name you want, and set `NODE_ENV` to `production` or `development`.

> [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) is the package manager used.

Production

```sh
pnpm start
```

```sh
pnpm dev
```
